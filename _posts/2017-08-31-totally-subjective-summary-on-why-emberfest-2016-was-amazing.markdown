title: Totally subjective summary on why EmberFest'16 was amazing - and why EmberFest'17 will be
---

When I learned that EmberFest'16 was to be held in my hometown, Budapest, I
could barely contain my excitement. I attended all previous EmberFests in other
beautiful cities across Europe, but the idea that for one I didn't have to go to
EmberFest because EmberFest came to me was almost too much to take.
