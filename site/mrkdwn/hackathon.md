Ember Fest Hackathon?
=====================

Day 4 of Ember Fest might be a hands-on hackathon/Coding Dojo! But in order to make adding a fourth day a financial possibility, you need to pitch in by purchasing your ticket early!

<div class="hotelArea">
    If we sell a total of 50 tickets before May 20th, we will be in a good position to add a fourth day to the event. This day will be organized as a coding-session with less structure and more hands-on experiences!
    <p>Be sure to book your ticket right away in order to make this fourth day possible for the organizers to put together!</p>
