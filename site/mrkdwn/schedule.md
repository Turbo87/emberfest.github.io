Schedule
========

August 30th will be the main event at EmberFest. During this day there will be a number of talks given by Ember.js community members. If you are harboring an inner speaker and a talk related to Ember.js, please do not hesitate to submit a proposal on your own!

<div class="hotelArea">
<h1>Ember Fest Hackathon, on August 31st?</h1>

If we sell a total of 50 tickets before May 20th, we will be in a good position to add a fourth day to the event. This day will be organized as a coding-session with less structure and more hands-on experiences!

<p>Be sure to book your ticket right away in order to make this fourth day possible for the organizers to put together!</p>
