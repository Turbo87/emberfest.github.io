Welcome to Ember Camp Europe!
=============================

Ember Fest will be a three day event in late August or late September, in or near a major European city. The date and venue will be decided upon soon, based on your participation. If you want to see Ember Fest happen in your home country, be sure to register your interest by <a href="http://signup.embercampeurope.com">signing up</a>.

The goal of Ember Fest is split into two parts, across three days. The first two days will be a hands on 2-day introductory course on Ember.js, while the third day will be organized as a single-track mini-conference with talks and tutorials. 

Training, talks and tutorials will be held by people with first hand Ember.js experience, where they will share their knowledge and spread the word on Ember.js' awesomeness!

The location for the event will be based on your interest and your residing country!

Pricing for the event will be split into three parts:

- Seperate pricing for the training

- Seperate pricing for the mini-conference

- Package price for both events

Updates will be tweeted from the <a href="https://twitter.com/EmberFest">@EmberFest</a> twitter account.
