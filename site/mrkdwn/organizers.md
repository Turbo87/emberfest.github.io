Ember Camp Europe Organizers
============================

The core team of organizers for Ember Camp Europe consists of people close to the Ember.js community, spread across Europe. Our aim is to create the most amazing Ember.js related event that we possibly can. 

The core team consists of: 

Joachim Haagen Skeie
--------------------

Joachim is the author of Ember.js in Action, and have been working with Ember.js for a long time. In fact, long enough to remember when the framework was still touted and developed to become SproutCore 2.0. Through his company, Haagen Software, he is working on revamping and bootstrapping the Open Source Application Monitoring tool EurekaJ, based on Ember.js.  Due to the fact that there were few Ember.js related happenings in Europe, he started the incentive to get Ember Camp Europe started and off the ground.

Adam Hawkins

Adam is an active member in the Ruby and Ember communities. Just over a year ago, he made the decision to switch over his company's product to Ember.js. Since then he's been very active in Javascript community. He's primarily known for his work on Iridium (a Javascript application build tool) and around testing Javascript application. He's been travelling around Europe for the past year trying to get people interested in Ember, leveling up their Javascript, and contributing back to the local community where ever he is.
