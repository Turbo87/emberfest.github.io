<img src="/img/venue_location.png" style="float: right;" />You will find Ember Fest in München, DE at the <span style="font-weight: 900">Holiday Inn Munich City Centre</span>, located at Hochstrasse 3 (<a href="http://www.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=de&geocode=&q=hochstrasse+3,+munich&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=27.919765,59.238281&ie=UTF8&ll=48.133158,11.589847&spn=0.011457,0.028925&z=15&iwloc=addr&om=1">view map</a>). The venue is located right in the heart of Munich within walking distance from Marienplatz. We have reserved space for 100 people, but we will be able to grow the event if we sell out within a reasonable time before the conference starts. 

München is located right in the middle of Europe. With a city motto of "München mag dich" (Munich likes you), we are sure all attendees of Ember Fest will feel right at home in this Bavarian city!
