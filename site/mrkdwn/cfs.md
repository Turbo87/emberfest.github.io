Talks are either 20 or 35 minutes long. Please note in your abstract how long you estimate your talk to be. 

Workshops/Tutorials

We want to be able to offer a few hands-on workshops/tutorials. The details about the arrangement of these are not yet finalized. You can influence the setup by submitting an abstract!

What you get!

Speakers with accepted abstracts get free admission to the mini-conference day (day 3) and will get invited to the Speakers Dinner.
