Ember Fest Hacathon, Day four?
---------------------------------
If we sell a total of 50 tickets before May 20th, we will be in a good position to add a fourth day to the event. This day will be organized as a coding-session with less structure and more hands-on experiences! Be sure to book your ticket right away in order to make this fourth day possible for the organizers to put together!
