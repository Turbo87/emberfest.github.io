<h2>Ember Fest 2013 - Munich</h2>

<p>
  Ember Fest 2013 was an absolute success! Ember Fest Munich offered two days
  of introductory Ember.js training, a world-class Hackathon as well as a
  full day conference. After the main event, a proper Bavarian celebration
  was played out at the amazing Hofbr√§uhaus.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.infoq.com">InfoQ</a> were kind enough to send their
  videographer to film the presentations. These will be published on their
  website throughout the rest of 2013. Once the talks are made available,
  a link will be provided in the table below.
