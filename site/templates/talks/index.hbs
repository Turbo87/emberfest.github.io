<h3>Submit a Talk!</h3>
<p>
  Do you have something you want to share with the Ember.js community?
  Do you have a cool idea, have you worked on a cool project, or have you
  learnt something awesome lately? Share your experiences with the rest of
  the European Ember.js community at Ember Fest 2014! All speakers get free
  admission to the Conference, and the Conference Dinner.
</p>

<p>
  This year, we are looking for both workshops and presentations! Workshops
  will be held during the 2-day pre-conference workshop. This is where you
  will get to meet developers that are eager to learn all about the awesomeness
  that is Ember.js.
</p>

<p>
  By registering your talk, your abstract for a presentation talk or a tutorial
  will be added to the list of suggestions for this year's conference. You may
  change the content of your abstract at any time during the period that the
  CfP is open. Other participants will be able to see your suggestion as soon
  as it is registered.
</p>

<p>
  The talk proposals will be reviewed by a group of smart and friendly people,
  who will help you create the best proposal you can. You will receive feedback
  from reviewers by email.
</p>

<h3>Deadline</h3>
<p>Call for Papers will end on May 15th. However, as we are accepting talks continuously,
all spots might be taken before the final deadline, so get your talk submitted as early
as possible!</p>

<h3>Topics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ember.js Basics</li>
  <li>Thrid party frameworks</li>
  <li>Ember.js Persistence frameworks</li>
  <li>Hands-on experiences and experience reports</li>
  <li>Security</li>
  <li>Build Tools</li>
</ul>

<h3>Talk Types</h3>

<p>
  There are four talk types that you can choose between. Standard presentations
  are either 20 or 35 minutes in length and will be held during the two main
  days of the conference. Workshops are held during the two pre-conference days
  and are either half day (3,5 hours including breaks), or full
  day (7 hours including breaks)
