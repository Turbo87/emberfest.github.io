<h3>Submit a Talk!</h3>
<p>
  Do you have something you want to share with the Ember.js community?
  Do you have a cool idea, have you worked on a cool project, or have you
  learnt something awesome lately? Share your experiences with the rest of
  the European Ember.js community at Ember Fest 2014! All speakers get free
  admission to the Conference, and the Conference Dinner.
</p>

<p>
  This year, we are looking for both workshops and presentations! The days will be split in two
    where the first half will consist of lightning talks and presentations, while the second
    half will consist of workshops, a hackathon as well as an open space session. There will only
    be one ticket type this year, which includes everything the conference has to offer!
</p>

<p>
  By registering your talk, your abstract for a presentation, lightning talk or a workshop
  will be added to the list of suggestions for this year's conference. You may
  change the content of your abstract at any time during the period that the
  Call for Speakers is open. Other participants will be able to see your suggestion as soon
  as it is registered.
</p>

<p>
  The talk proposals will be reviewed by a group of smart and friendly people,
  who will help you create the best proposal you can. You will receive feedback
  from reviewers by email.
</p>
