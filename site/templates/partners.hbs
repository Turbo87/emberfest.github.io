    <p>Conference partners are often what separates a good conference from a great conference! Having partners come on board early means that we will be able to plan and execute the event on a much larger scale!</p>
    <p>Ember Fest 2013 was a complete success, and for 2014 we have set our ambitions even higher! Hosted in Barcelona, Spain, Ember Fest 2014 will consist of a training course, workshops and an awesome 2-day conference! This is your chance to pitch in, in order to grow the Europena Ember.js community, and to make your brand know to the Ember.js Developers!</p>
    <p>There are multiple partnership options for 2014, which means you can choose a level that fits you! We want all partners to have the opportunity to join us at the conference!</p>
