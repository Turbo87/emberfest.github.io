Ember Camp Europe Organizers
============================

The core team of organizers for Ember Camp Europe consists of people close to the Ember.js community, spread across Europe. Our aim is to create the most amazing Ember.js related event that we possibly can. 

The core team consists of: 

Joachim Haagen Skeie
--------------------

Joachim is the author of Ember.js in Action, and have been working with Ember.js for a long time. In fact, long enough to remember when the framework was still touted and developed to become SproutCore 2.0. Through his company, Haagen Software, he is working on revamping and bootstrapping the Open Source Application Monitoring tool EurekaJ, based on Ember.js.  Due to the fact that there were few Ember.js related happenings in Europe, he started the incentive to get Ember Camp Europe started and off the ground.
